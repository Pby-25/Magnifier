Simply press `Alt`+`Z`* to summon the magnifying glass! Then press any key to remove it.

The magnifying glass shows a zoomed image within its radius, without disturbing the rest of the page.

"A magnifying glass is like an umbrella. Sometimes, it could save you a lot of hassle if you have it on hand."

***Please note that the extension does not work in new tab page, chrome web store or chrome setting page by default, but it should work on any other webpages. You can also enable compatibility mode to make it compatible with the aforementioned pages.***

**customizable, `Ctrl`+`Z` for MAC users*

The magnifier is built upon [this tutorial](http://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/magnifying-glass-for-images-using-jquery-and-css3).
